# Playground for ReactJS
 
 This was initially intended for just charts/graphs, but has expanded since and has become a place where I have tested various features/components that I used for other sites.
 
This web application was created making use of libraries such as: ReactJS, Recharts, & Jquery.

## Current Status

Currently this site is non-functional because I didn't fully realize how to implement Puppeteer into this. I made the mistake of not creating a backend for this site, so all of the work is primarily in the front-end portion. Due to this, trying to implement Puppeteer broke the webpage because it is meant for the backend portion. I am rectifying this issue by removing the Puppeteer portion and moving onto a new webpage that is created with a front-end and back-end setup properly.

## Charts Displayed W/ Recharts

### Line Chart
 - A simple line graph where points are plotted and lines are drawn from each point is created.
 - Optional:
    - ConnectNulls - any empty space between points will be filled with a line connecting the 2 points

### Bar Chart
 - A multi-part bar graph that displays 2 sets of values across any desired range

### Area Chart

### Pie Chart

### Scatter Chart

### Radar Chart

### Radial Bar Chart

### Line Of Best Fit Chart

## Buttons/Dropdowns

### React Dropdown Animated
 - This dropdown card was created with React and React-Bootstrap.
 
### Dropdown Animated JS/CSS
 - This dropdown card was created with pure JavaScript and CSS

### Dropdown Animated HTML
 - This dropdown card was created with just HTML
   - Yes I learned the details tag was a thing after creating the other 2

## Animations

### PickAxe
 - I was inspired by an animation used at my work where it a simple hammer rotating to give depth to the meaning of "building" in a more visual way.
   - I figured the pickaxe would use similar animation styles and I wanted to give it a shot.

### SlideShow
 - The slideshow currently has 2 methods of traversal
   - Manual Traversal
     - Arrows on the images themselves
     - Arrows + specific image traversal (numbered buttons to choose a specific image to display)
   - Automatic Traversal
     - Currently not working but I plan to add this
